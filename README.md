# Payify

PayifyRails is a Ruby gem that simplifies payment integration into Ruby on Rails projects. It allows to easily add payment functionality to your models. For example, by applying the HasPaymentConcern to a reservation model, you can manage the payment process for reservations seamlessly.

## Installation

To install the gem add it into a Gemfile (Bundler):

```ruby
gem 'payify', '~> 0.1.0'
```

And then execute:

```
bundle install
```

## Features âœ…

- Includes a Payment model
- Provides concerns to easily add a payment system to your model
- Enables payment with Stripe
- Offers a payment form to integrate into your application
- Allows payment status to be checked via an api route
- Allows configuration of payment (currency, VAT)
- Provides a user interface for payment processing
- Enables management of payment status (pending, paid)

## Configuration

For now, Payify uses Stripe as the payment gateway. You can configure the currency using an initializer.

```ruby
# initializers/payify.rb
Payify.setup do |config|
  config.currency = "usd"
  config.default_tax_rates_id = "eur"
end
```

To handle VAT or different tax rates on your payments, you need to create tax rates on Stripe and define the default_tax_rates_id or, alternatively, define the tax_rates_id method on your payment-related models. Leave it empty if you don't manage any taxes.

You can set your Stripe API credentials using environment variables. (Secret key, Publishable key)

```ruby
# .env
STRIPE_API_KEY="..."
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="..."
```

## Usage

To enable payment functionality for a model, simply include the HasPayment concern:

```ruby
class Reservation < ApplicationRecord
  include Payify::HasPaymentConcern

  def ammount_to_pay
    self.price
  end

  # Optional : Override the default tax rates id
  def tax_rates_id
    'txr_1234567890'
  end
end
```

When you want to request a payment for a model on which you added the concern, you just need to call the create_payment method.

```ruby
reservation_1.create_payment
```

Then you can find the id of the new pending payment with payment.id.

```ruby
reservation_1.payment.id
```

Now you just have to redirect the user to `/payments/:id/new` or include the payment form in your page.

```ruby
# reservation/show.html.erb
<%= render "payify/payments/form", payment: @payment %>
```

After completing the payment process, the user will be redirected to:

```
/payments/:id/complete
```

The application will then verify the payment status with Stripe. You can do it manually calling the following method:

```ruby
@payment.stripe_confirm_payment
```

If the payment has been successfully processed, a confirmation message will be displayed to the user. The payment method `paid?` will return `true`.

To customize the page that displays the payment status, you can create the following file:

```ruby
# views/payify/payments/complete.html.erb

<% if @payment.paid? %>
  <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
    <%= I18n.t("payments.complete.paid") %>
  </div>
<% else %>
  <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    <%= I18n.t("payments.complete.pending") %>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

## API

If you prefer using the Payify API, after creating the payment object, you can initialize a new Stripe payment by making a request to: `/payments/:id/new.json`

This request will return a JSON response containing the `stripe_payment_intent_id` and `stripe_client_secret` required to process a payment using Stripe.

After making the payment, you can make a request to the following endpoint to update the payment status and retrieve its current state:

```
/payments/:id/complete.json
```

## Status

You can access the payment status using `@payment.status`. The possible statuses are:

- `pending`: The payment is still being processed.
- `paid`: The payment has been successfully completed.
- `failed`: The payment has failed.

## Tests

To run the tests, execute `rspec` command.

You can test the payment process in your web browser by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the `test/dummy` directory.
2. Run the following commands:
   - `rails db:create`
   - `rails db:migrate`
   - `rails db:seed`
   - `rails s`
3. Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

Each time you run the seed command, your test database will be reset with a reservation that has a payment with an ID of 1. This allows you to test the payment process at the following address: [http://localhost:3000/payments/1/new](http://localhost:3000/payments/1/new).
